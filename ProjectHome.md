_SNAC_ (Snac is Not at All a CMS) is a client-side content management system. It allows you to separate site content from design. Design is represented by a template, while content is stored in separate text files.

SNAC Wiki in English is not ready yet. Meanwhile you can read more about SNAC and its features in Russian at the [project site](http:///www.mavsic.ru/snac).
